# Hubble Constant Estimation

## Introduction
Since the earlier days, astronomers believed that the observable universe represents the actual size of universe, and this size is in fact constant. However Edwin Hubble discovered in 1929 that the universe was actually expanding, owing to the higher speeds of more distant objects than the nearby objects. He gave an equation for determining the expansion of the universe: V = H~0~D, where H~0~ is called Hubble Constant. This result paved way to branch of astronomy that we know today as modern cosmology.

## Role of Distance Ladders
The value of Hubble Constant has been a topic of debate for many decades. In order to measure this value, the precise distance to the objects whose recession velocities we are measuring should also be known. The various methods used to measure this distance are called 'Distance Ladders'. The problem however is that different distance ladders give different H~0~ values. There are a variety of Distance ladders used such as Supernovae (both Type I and II), Gravitational lenses, Tully Fisher, Cepheids, Masers, Cosmic Microwave Background and many more. Each of them differ by a certain range in the H~0~ values they predict. Therefore unique distance ladders are being searched which can restrict the expansion rate of our universe with a small error margin.

## Baryonic Tully Fisher relation
Tully Fisher relation relates luminosity of a galaxy with its rotational velocity. The relation indicates that galaxies with higher rotational velocities tend to have higher luminosities. This is because galaxies with higher rotational velocities typically have more mass and therefore emit more light. Therefore the modification in TFR that directly relates the baryonic mass (mass of stars + gas, excluding the dark matter) with the rotational velocity is called BTFR. BTFR gives insights into the actual mass distribution of in the galaxy, and can help towards search for Dark matter.

## Outline of this project

This project deals with only 3 distance ladder techniques: BTFR, Cepheids and Standard candles(Type I supernovae). We have also compared our results with Virial Theorem to estimate ideal mass corresponding to the observed velocity dispersion, which basically states that average kinetic energy of the system is equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the average potential energy. The detailed analysis can be found in the project report.

## Future Implications
A solid constraint on Hubble constant in future can determine the actual expansion rate of the universe. The expansion rate along with the age of the universe can yield the size of the universe. This will help to further pinpoint the kinetic energy produced by the Big Bang, ultimately leading us towards answering the long standing questions about singularity. Thus the solution to the problem of Hubble constant accuracy can lead to a better understanding of birth of the universe.
